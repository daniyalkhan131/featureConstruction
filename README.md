# featureConstruction

four types of feature engineering-
	feature tranformation
		missing value imputation
		handling categorical feature
		outlier detection
		feature scaling
	feature construction
		feature splitting
	feature selection
	feature extraction

feature construction-
is totally mannual
we need logical thinking to do that, and domain knowledge and experience

we do construct family type col. using sibling an dparent cols in titanic


feature splitting-
when cells dont have atomic value (data in col. is not tidy)
like name is Mr Danu so you can split them into two cols, one for salutation and other for 
name
